//  Question#11

// Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

let frnd: string[]=["Hoorain","Faiza","Ayesha","Tooba"]
for (let frnds of frnd) 
{

// print a personalize message for each friend

console.log(`Good morning ${frnd}, I hope you are having a fantastic day!`)}
