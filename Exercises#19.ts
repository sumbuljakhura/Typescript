 // Question#20

// Think of something you could store in a array. For example, you could make a list of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items.

// Creating an array of countries
const countries: Array<string>  = ['USA', 'Canada', 'France', 'Japan', 'Australia'];

// Creating an array of cities
const cities: Array<string>  = ['New York', 'Paris', 'Tokyo', 'Sydney', 'Toronto'];

// Creating an array of languages
const languages: Array<string> = ['English', 'French', 'Japanese', 'Spanish', 'German'];

// Print the arrays
console.log('List of Countries:', countries);
console.log('List of Cities:', cities);
console.log('List of Languages:', languages);
